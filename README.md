# Echo Chamber
Hopefully this counts as signals. So the original idea was to have a game where you play a rythm game to keep up your signal which would be used to communicate to your mother over a text simulator. But since I ran out of time I just commented that stuff out and we are left with a wave/signal to represent your health/score and a timer as well to show the time left needed to win! This is probably not my greatest work but I due (uni apps + tests that I'm very unprepared for) this is what I could do...

Anyways the current game idea is you are sending 0s and 1s by ensuring you are in sync with the signal. You need to do this because humanity needs you. You are their last hope... Now you better starting sending those 0s and 1s before its too late!!!

This game like my previous games have been using purely Kaplay.js library!
